        <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.<br><br>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.<br><br>Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backwards-compatible.  Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.<br><br>Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.   </p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b><u>THE USES OF PYTHON</u></b></h1>
        <p>Python is used as a scripting language for web applications. It has the ability to automate specific series of tasks making it more efficient than other languages. Python is most commonly used in software applications (excluding applications such as games) and pages within a web browser
            . Python can be used in some aspects of game applications but cannot solely be used to make the game, it is also found and applicable in shells of operating systems.<br><br>The language is used in scientific and mathematical computing, and even in AI projects. It’s been successfully embedded in numerous software products, including visual effects compositor Nuke, 3D modellers and animation packages.<br><br><h3 style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Places You’ve Seen Python:</b></u></h3>Like other coding languages, Python is one of the unseen elements that we benefit from without knowing it.<br><br>YouTube, Instagram and Quora are among the countless sites that use Python. Much of Dropbox’s code is Python (where Van Rossum works now), Python has been used extensively by digital special effects house ILM (whose work spans across all of the Star Wars and Marvel films) and it’s a favourite of electronics titan Philips.<br><br>Some other places you might find python used in is: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science and Data Visualisation, Desktop Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), Web scraping applications, Business applications, Audio and Video applications, CAD Applications and Embedded Applications. Python is almost the most common language to be taught in places of education due to its wide-range of uses across many different fields of ICT.

        <p>PMA (Python: Made Easy) is an educational site for those new to python. The site teaches a wide range of python-related topics ranging from its origins, how to get started with downloads to beginner code. Another feature of Python known as discord.py will also be spoken of throughout the site since discord's rapid growth has also created an increase of bot development across the platform and is becoming quite common across the platform. This site will not only give you background information on python and easy-to-follow guides, it will also ensure that when you are done with the site, you will have at the very least a basic understanding of python. Python has many IDEs that support python that we'll be going through, these include IDLE, PyCharm, Visual Studio Code and much more. Head to the PythonAPI page to find more!  </p>
